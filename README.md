# 🏥 OPD Service – Microservice Design (From Scratch)

## 📌 Overview

The **OPD Service** is a practice-oriented microservice designed to simulate a real-world **Outpatient Department (OPD)** workflow.
The primary goal of this project is **architectural learning**, **clean domain modeling**, and **professional microservice development**, rather than immediate database or event-driven complexity.

This service is built incrementally in **phases**, with **strict scope locking** to avoid over-engineering.

## 🌐 API Structure

### Root Context

```
/
```

Controllers are separated to maintain **Separation of Concerns**.

---

### 📘 Phase-1 Controllers

#### `/consultation`

* `/create` → Create consultation
* `/get` → Fetch consultation
* `/update` → Update consultation. must be able to alter data like payId, samples, child consultations etc (meta data pf consultation by the staff and must only have access to them)
* '/process' -> patient doc interaction(docs only must be able to add meds notes add tests)

#### `/patient`

* `/add` → Add patient + patient details
* `/update` → Update patient
* `/addEmergencyContact` → Add emergency contact
* `/updateEmergencyContact` → Update emergency contact
* `/get` → Get patient contact details by patientId

---

### 📗 Phase-2 Controllers

#### `/home`

* `/getAllPatients`
* `/getAllDoctors`
* `/getAllPayments`
* `/getAllConsultations`

#### `/pay` (Separate Microservice)

* `/pay`
* `/payVia/{mode}`
* `/getStatus/{id}`
* `/get/{id}`

## Application Architecture Designing: 

### 1️⃣ Bounded Context Lock (MUST DO)

* This service **owns OPD-related data only**
* Model Classes(Builder), Req/Resp DTOs are as well decided
* It manages:

  * Doctors
  * Technicians
  * Patients (only OPD-specific data)
  * Consultations
  * Tests
  * Prescriptions
  * Notes

### 🚫 Explicitly NOT Owned by This Service

* Global patient master data
* Actual payment logic

### 🔗 Cross-Service References

* Holds **reference IDs only** for:

  * Consultations
  * Tests
  * Payments

> The service stores **only patient data relevant to OPD visits**, not the global patient profile.
</br>

### Mode- DTO Design:
Consultation          → Domain model (Builder)
CreateConsultationReq → API input
ConsultationEntity    → JPA (if used , optional)
ConsultationResponse  → API output

Controller  →  Service  →  DAO
                ↑
        DTO → Model(builder) mapping




### 2️⃣ API Contracts Finalization (MUST DO)

* Communication style: **HTTP + REST**
* APIs are designed **before implementation**
* Endpoints are predefined and stable

### API Design Rules

* If request/response matches UML entities → use entities directly
* If response is a combination of multiple entities → create **DTOs**
* HTTP methods:

  * `POST` → Create operations
  * `GET` → Read operations (used even for fetch operations for enhanced security)
</br>


### 3️⃣ Domain Model Freeze (CRITICAL)

* All **ID fields are immutable**
* Other immutable fields are clearly marked in the UML
* Once frozen:

  * No structural changes without strong justification
  * Ensures stable contracts and data consistency
</br>


### 4️⃣ Data Ownership & Tables (MUST DO)

* **Phase 1 focus**:

  * Design correctness
  * Entity modeling
  * API testing using dummy data
* No immediate DB integration

### Current Assumption

* DTOs are treated as **logical tables**
* Actual DB integration will be done **after domain + API maturity**

> Database work will be introduced as a **separate learning phase**, not mixed with core design.
</br>


### 5️⃣ Event Strategy (IMPORTANT)

* Phase 1 uses **synchronous REST**
* Kafka or async messaging is **intentionally deferred**
* Event strategy will be designed **after**:

  * UML
  * APIs
  * Services
  * Tables

> Event-driven architecture will be added **only when the design demands it**, not upfront.
</br>


### 6️⃣ Non-Functional Decisions (Often Ignored)

* Will be added gradually as learning progresses
* Includes:

  * Performance
  * Security
  * Scalability
  * Observability
</br>


### 7️⃣ Phase-1 Scope Lock (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Phase-1 Capabilities

* Add patients
* Add consultations
* Use existing:

  * Doctors
  * Tests
  * Reference data

> **No scope creep allowed** in Phase-1.

## 🧩Creating A Repo Day-0: Standard Professional Workflow (Git + GitHub)

### Clean Repository Flow

1. Create Spring Boot starter project
2. Initialize Git locally:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```
3. First clean commit:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup"
   ```
4. Create GitHub repository
   ⚠️ **Do NOT add README or license during repo creation**

> Adding files in GitHub creates an initial commit that leads to **unrelated histories**

5. Link remote repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repo-url>
   ```
6. Push local repository as the source of truth
7. Continue development using commits and branches
